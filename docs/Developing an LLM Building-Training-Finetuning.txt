This extensive guide provides a comprehensive overview of Large Language Models (LLMs), detailing their development lifecycle from building and training to fine-tuning. It emphasizes crucial processes like data preparation and tokenization, explaining how raw text is transformed into numerical data for models to process. The source also explores various methods for optimizing LLM performance, such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for real-time external knowledge, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for cost-effective specialization, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) for enabling external interactions. Finally, it addresses the evaluation of LLMs, outlining benchmarks and practical considerations for ensuring quality and effective real-world application.
